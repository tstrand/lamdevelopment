subheader-text: We're bringing Solar to New York State
section1-title: We provide solar to municipalities
subsection1-title: Focus
subsection1-body: LAM Development focuses on bringing renewable, affordable power
  to municipalities. We accomplish this by leveraging our vast network with utilities,
  construction firms, and real estate companies to quickly and efficiently meet the
  power needs of our clients. Our knowledge and experience as solar developers allows
  us to bring together the most capable contractors in order to maximize the positive
  impact on the town and the environment.
subsection2-title: Logistics
subsection2-body: We start by working with the town to determine if renewable energy
  is right for them. Then, by working alongside the utility company and the municipality,
  we determine the optimal site for a solar project which meets all parties’ needs.
  At this point we survey the land, design the facility, and verify that it conforms
  with the town’s zoning regulations. Once all pertinent approvals are achieved and
  the municipality signs off on the project’s construction, the solar system is built
  and immediately begins producing affordable electricity.
subsection3-title: Motivation
subsection3-body: Our goal is to fight the harmful dependence on fossil fuels by building
  solar energy systems. LAM Development sees New York as a site with great potential
  for this mission, due to the historical underdevelopment of renewable energy, and
  the political changes occurring as a result of Governor Cuomo’s Reforming the Energy
  Vision. Furthermore, selling power to municipalities has distinct advantages, chiefly
  their large capacity demands. By providing municipal governments with renewable
  power, we are able to maximize our contribution to diminishing the dependence on
  fossil fuels, and simultaneously lower the cost of power for our clients.
