subheader-text: We're bringing Solar to New York State
subsection1-title: Local Action That Benefits Your Community
subsection1-body: LAM Development believes solar energy should be available to everyone. We focus on bringing cost-saving renewable power to local municipalities, enabling communities of all sizes to attain energy security.<br/><br/>Through the deployment of smaller, locally based solar farms we are able to provide clean, affordable energy in a responsible way.
subsection2-title: We Bring You the Best in the Business
subsection2-body: In order to bring solar energy to local communities, we leverage our vast network of partnerships with utilities, construction firms, and real estate companies to quickly and efficiently meet the energy needs of our clients.<br/><br/>Our knowledge and expertise as the region’s premier solar developer allows us to bring together the most capable firms in each field to bring together the best practices and results.
subsection3-title: Lasting Partnerships For Lasting Results
subsection3-body: We understand that residents know what is best for their own municipality. Therefore, we approach each solar project as an opportunity to collaborate with the community. LAM Development works to understand the unique needs and desires of all stakeholders, and maximize the positive results for everyone involved. We are here to listen, learn, and help craft the best possible solar solution.
subsection4-title: We Make Solar Easy
subsection4-body: Our process begins by working with the municipality to identify its energy needs and determine if solar energy is the right option for the community. Then, in conjunction with the utility company and the town, we find the optimal site for a solar project that meets all parties’ requirements.<br/><br/>At this point we survey the land, design the facility, and verify the planning conforms to land use regulations, all the while informing the municipality of progress and tailoring the project based on valued feedback. Once all approvals are received and the municipality gives the final ok, the solar farm is built and immediately provides affordable, renewable energy.
subsection5-title: The Time For Solar Is Now
subsection5-body: LAM Development understands the immense potential for solar energy in New York State. Over the last few years, incredible strides in the advancement of solar technology have made solar the most compelling energy option. Today’s solar panels are more efficient, more reliable, and cheaper than panels available in the past.
