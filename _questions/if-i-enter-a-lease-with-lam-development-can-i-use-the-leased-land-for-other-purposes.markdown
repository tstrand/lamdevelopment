title: If I enter a lease with LAM Development, can I use the leased land for other
  purposes?
date: 2017-02-16 20:13:00 Z
type: lease
body: 'Over the term of the lease LAM Development will utilize between 15-20 acres
  of land for the solar energy facility. If the landowner wishes, they may seek permission
  from LAM Development to allow grazing by certain livestock within the fenced-in
  area of the solar facility. Other activities are not allowed to take place within
  the solar energy facility due to safety concerns. Landowners may use non-leased
  land (i.e. land not within the fenced-in solar farm but part of the same property)
  for any purpose they wish. '
