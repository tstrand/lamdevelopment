title: Will a solar energy facility change my property taxes?
date: 2017-02-16 20:09:00 Z
type: lease
body: Under a lease agreement, LAM Development will pay property taxes on the section
  of land we lease to build a solar farm. Additionally, if the parcel ownerâ€™s taxes
  increase due to a change in tax status (i.e. loss of an agricultural exemption),
  LAM Development will pay for the increase.
