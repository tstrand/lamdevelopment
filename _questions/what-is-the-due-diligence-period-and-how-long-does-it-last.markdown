title: What is the due diligence period and how long does it last?
date: 2017-02-16 19:50:00 Z
type: general
body: The due diligence period is when LAM Development vets a parcel to ensure it
  is a viable location for solar energy. This period takes place after a lease agreement
  is signed. We ask for a 16-month due diligence period to vet a parcel, but typically
  we aim to complete all the necessary steps in 8-10 months.
