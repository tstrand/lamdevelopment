title: When is a lease signed?
date: 2017-02-16 19:49:00 Z
type: lease
body: 'A lease is signed once the landowner feels comfortable to move forward with
  the development process and have LAM Development begin vetting their parcel. LAM
  Development requires a signed lease before starting the due diligence period for
  two reasons: (i) a significant amount of money is invested into vetting a parcel
  and LAM Development needs assurance we will be able to build on a viable property
  we invest in; (ii) New York law requires proof of land control to obtain permits
  necessary for development of a solar farm. '
