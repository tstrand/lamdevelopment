title: What are the environmental impacts of a solar energy facility?
date: 2017-02-16 19:44:00 Z
type: general
body: Solar panels provide clean electricity and do not release carbon or toxic emissions
  as they produce power. LAM Development only uses panels that are safe for the local
  environment and hardware that does not leak dangerous chemicals. During the planning
  and construction process, we work to mitigate disruption of local habitats and reduce
  any effect on local wildlife. That said, most solar energy facilities require a
  minimal degree of tree and brush clearing to create an open space for the panels.
