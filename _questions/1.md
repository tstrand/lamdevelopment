title: What is a solar energy facility?
position: 0
type: general
body: A solar farm is a collection of solar panels that produce energy by capturing
  the sunâ€™s rays. The solar panels are mounted on a racking system that holds them
  off the ground. Each panel is between 5-15 feet tall and they are set in rows at
  an optimal angle to collect sunlight. The solar panels create direct current (DC)
  power. This power is converted by an inverter into alternating (AC) power. This
  AC power is then fed into the electric grid to supply local municipalities, businesses,
  and residences with electricity.
