section1-title: The time for solar is now
subsection1-title: Improved Panel Technology
subsection1-body: Over the last decade, great strides have been made in the advancement
  of solar technology, making them a more viable clean energy solution today. Unlike
  previous generations, modern panels produce little to no glare, they make are quiet,
  and new electrical systems technology allows for better monitoring of the solar
  facility. Ultimately, modern solar energy systems are far safer and less invasive
  than they once were, and as such are one of the most compelling renewable energy
  options.
subsection2-title: Deforestation
subsection2-body: Solar farms often require a moderate amount of deforestation in
  order to make room for the solar panels. While this as an unfortunate side effect,
  it is more than offset by the environmental benefits of the solar facility. LAM
  works hard to minimize the necessary deforestation, often using farmland or landfills
  to avoid unnecessary deforestation.
subsection3-title: Decommissioning the System
subsection3-body: Because of the finite lifespan of solar systems, which is typically
  around 25 years, there is often concern about what happens to the solar equipment
  at the end of that period. Because solar farms are a relatively new technology,
  although there are many solar farms, very few have been decommissioned. However,
  even after the system has ceased generating power, the components still have value,
  either as scrap or recyclables. As a result, LAM Development is able to sell the
  rights of the system at the end of its life to a salvage company, which will remove
  all of the equipment from the land, and sell the components for a profit. At the
  end of the project's life, LAM guarantees to return the land to its natural state,
  and makes sure that no component of the system remain on any part of the land.
