subsection1-title: Take Part in the Solar Revolution
subsection1-body: LAM Development offers landowners a variety of ways to monetize
  their land, including lease and purchase agreements.
subsection1-title-2: Flexibility and insight allow us to meet the specific needs of
  every landowner. LAM Development's goal is to present individuals with opportunities
  to generate income for themselves while helping their community benefit from solar.
subsection1-body-2: "<br/>Through a partnership with LAM Development your land will
  be used to provide clean, renewable energy for generations to come. Land leased
  or sold to LAM Development will be used to produce cost-saving solar energy, improve
  your local community, lower municipal electricity costs, and help bring about a
  brighter future.<br/><br/> By partnering with LAM Development landowners are not
  responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the solar facility.
  LAM Development works to ensure any aesthetic or environmental concerns of the landowners
  are addresses throughout the lifetime of the solar energy facility. The land we
  use is returned to its original condition at the end of a land lease."
subsection2-title: We're here to help
subsection2-body: LAM Development helps communities lower their utility bills through
  a transition to clean solar energy. Utilizing our expertise, we provide the assistance
  needed to navigate all steps of the process.
subsection2-title-2: Working Together Towards a Brighter Future
subsection2-body-2: 'A transition to clean, cost-saving solar is ultimately a choice
  made by and for local residents. As a leader in solar development, we strive to
  foster a lasting and meaningful partnership with communities.<br/><br/>LAM Development
  ensures all of its projects are informed by three guiding principles:'
subsection2-title-3: Open Dialogue with the Community
subsection2-body-3: From the initial meeting to the moment the solar energy facility
  starts to produce power, we ensure local stakeholders are involved in every aspect
  of the project. We engage with all parties to incorporate their feedback and guarantee
  that all needs and concerns are addressed.
subsection2-title-4: A Local Focus
subsection2-body-4: We understand that no two towns are alike, and that each project
  requires the careful consideration of a host of unique factors. With this in mind,
  we design each solar solution to maximize the benefits provided to the local community
  and tailor all plans according to local circumstance.
subsection2-title-5: Lasting Commitment
subsection2-body-5: LAM Development is here for the long term. We are focused on lasting
  relationships to guarantee your communityâ€™s switch to cost-saving, renewable energy
  is a success for decades to come.
subsection3-title: Helping Navigate the energy landscape
subsection3-body: The energy industry is in a state of incredible transition. As the
  technologies of tomorrow become the energy resources of today, there is near unlimited
  opportunities available.
subsection3-title-2: However, nothing can be accomplished if we fail to include the
  bedrock of our energy systems - utilities.
subsection3-body-2: This is why LAM Development works to align its interests with
  those of local utility companies. By working closely with the utilities whose load
  zones we operate in, we hope to ensure an efficient and pleasant partnership between
  the local community, the utility, and us.<br/><br/>As a part of every solar project
  we help create, LAM Development seeks to increase the benefits to both the local
  and regional grids.<br/><br/>Our close relationship to utility companies gives us
  a distinct comparative edge over our competitors, assuring the transition to renewable
  energy will be simple, seamless, and hassle-free.
